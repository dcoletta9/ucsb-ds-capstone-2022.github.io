Our team is currently trying out a multitude of programs to visualize our data regarding hypoxia in the Pacific Ocean off of the California coast. Our main objective is to see at which depths and locations off the coast have the most variability in milliliters of oxygen per liter and overall the least amount of oxygen concentration. We are using different visualization packages in R to best show the data we want to present.
